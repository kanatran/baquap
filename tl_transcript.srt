1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:05:15,157
Good evening your mom. Fine.

2
00:05:15,157 --> 00:05:30,129
Construction Headquarters construction. I went.

3
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:45,134
8 Akban Construction President Akban Opened the president's port.

4
00:05:45,134 --> 00:06:00,136
Since it's a big deal, I wanted to put it out as an auntie bag. January 25th. Akoukin construction has begun.

5
00:06:00,136 --> 00:06:15,059
Yes. 11 people. So that's it.

6
00:06:15,059 --> 00:06:30,048
shit.

7
00:06:30,048 --> 00:06:45,112
There was, so I will do that person around 24:30.

8
00:06:45,112 --> 00:07:00,122
It's a construction relay with 8 to 11 people. I still like it a little. Yes. Why do you like buying it?

9
00:07:00,122 --> 00:07:15,141
It's evil or it can do something like this. I want to do something like this. I'm thinking of having an interview.

10
00:07:15,141 --> 00:07:30,109
8 I would like to announce the time schedule for the head office construction relay yesterday.

11
00:07:30,109 --> 00:07:45,128
I announced it together, but I'll explain it for those who haven't seen it. Lineage Revo.

12
00:07:45,128 --> 00:08:00,144
I plan to do it. 8 Make a note. Next to the baton touch to the next person.

13
00:08:00,144 --> 00:08:15,126
On-site sterilization Look at every corner of the construction headquarters. What is snow?

14
00:08:15,126 --> 00:08:30,104
Cheaper than 30 minutes. Kana-chan at 21:30.

15
00:08:30,104 --> 00:09:00,138
It's Kyoto, isn't it? It looks like this. The next person's relay Be careful about the song of the person you like.

16
00:09:00,138 --> 00:09:15,105
Thank you for your cooperation. I want to do it. It will be a relay of.

17
00:09:15,105 --> 00:09:30,130
See you this time. The first suggestion would be 6 hours.

18
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:45,098
I think it's okay. 1 hour in my case.

19
00:09:45,098 --> 00:10:00,139
Do other work. It's noisy and maybe it's passing by.

20
00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:15,155
I'd be happy if you could take a look at it, so I'll cut the frame itself. The frame itself will be in 1 hour and 30 minutes. Let's do it right away.

21
00:10:15,155 --> 00:10:30,106
30 minutes tomorrow.

22
00:10:30,106 --> 00:10:45,105
Apart from the explanation of the relay. About 5 people.

23
00:10:45,105 --> 00:11:00,147
You logged in, right behind the scenes. It's not like I've already gathered together.

24
00:11:00,147 --> 00:11:15,137
President Akagi.

25
00:11:15,137 --> 00:11:30,113
It seems that there are already a lot of people preparing, but I'm looking forward to visiting. I'm looking forward to tomorrow. Once, I'll go back to my house and explain.

26
00:11:30,113 --> 00:12:00,121
Well, there is a relay until about 24:30. If possible. Hanshin.

27
00:12:00,121 --> 00:12:15,132
There were many people who said that they had a collaboration plan today, so it's okay to wear it at all.

28
00:12:15,132 --> 00:12:30,154
I'm thinking of getting that bridge. I will do it freely, so thank you. Sounds good.

29
00:12:30,154 --> 00:12:45,128
From Santa Claus.

30
00:12:45,128 --> 00:13:00,138
Wrap. Super rare pussy. Lots of here.

31
00:13:00,138 --> 00:13:15,138
8 Aku Forbidden Prefecture If you build it, you are planning to build a gacha here. There is, but uh.

32
00:13:15,138 --> 00:13:30,092
Since the cucumbers are free, we can exchange them for other cod and cod at this booth.

33
00:13:30,092 --> 00:13:45,147
I want to build it. I think this will be May. Maybe.

34
00:13:45,147 --> 00:14:15,129
I hope it goes around. am thinking.

35
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:30,138
Well, here it's pretty close to what it looks like. If you go over here, there will be a server tomorrow. There is an entrance.

36
00:14:30,138 --> 00:14:45,125
Kagami mochi. If there is a house, I will go through this road. Aquamarine video.

37
00:14:45,125 --> 00:15:00,138
This is King Black Emma. Maybe they will be happy. Gacha delivery that will please you.

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,124
English writing. Freezer Smile Smile.

39
00:00:15,124 --> 00:00:30,093
Watercress Benefits There is a construction building, but in front of it.

40
00:00:30,093 --> 00:00:45,130
People are noisy, so it's messed up here. In front of the aquamarine. I was told that I could commute by riding.

41
00:00:45,130 --> 00:01:00,176
That was the case. Compromised height is already noisy.

42
00:01:00,176 --> 00:01:15,084
It must be within 30 minutes by train. I really am.

43
00:01:15,084 --> 00:01:30,160
So I went to bed, but I did it on a budget and built Rakugaki.

44
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:45,120
You can also go by Elytra. Easy to access. Like this.

45
00:01:45,120 --> 00:02:00,138
everyone. The location is too bad.

46
00:02:00,138 --> 00:02:15,170
At any rate. The location is rainy and location.

47
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:30,142
Tokoname Headquarters This will be the basis of the head office relay.

48
00:02:30,142 --> 00:02:45,134
I used it as a reference. However. It's evolved a little from home, but it's a lot.

49
00:02:45,134 --> 00:03:00,103
Think in kanji.

50
00:03:00,103 --> 00:03:15,104
I think it's going to be a story like that. 1st floor A lot of space here.

51
00:03:15,104 --> 00:03:30,092
It came out twice.

52
00:03:30,092 --> 00:03:45,225
You can also decorate this freely. I'm Yuki Shinano I don't think everyone is aware of it. It's Yuki Koyuki.

53
00:03:45,225 --> 00:04:00,174
You thought it was a quartz block that was made, right? All. That older sister.

54
00:04:00,174 --> 00:04:15,173
Maybe this building. Instead, I was told a little like if there was snow, and I was surprised that Ramírez.

55
00:04:15,173 --> 00:04:30,129
Can be built. I spoke nothing.

56
00:04:30,129 --> 00:04:45,174
It's okay to build on the roof above this. It's hard to live though. It doesn't matter if you break it. Break this.

57
00:04:45,174 --> 00:05:00,152
It's better not to break what people made, but it's no good if it breaks due to an accident.

58
00:05:00,152 --> 00:05:15,166
It's a backyard, it's big, and it's around gold construction. I'm glad I'm happy, but maybe the pool, actually a little.

59
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:30,094
It doesn't matter if you use it already or if you pack it up here as well.

60
00:05:30,094 --> 00:05:45,079
Thank you. anything. 8.

61
00:05:45,079 --> 00:06:00,155
I have prepared it. Something that seems to be usable. but.

62
00:06:00,155 --> 00:06:30,114
Also, because of the architecture that was the basis for this time. Like this. Why can I use it freely?

63
00:06:30,114 --> 00:06:45,169
It's OK to use it. I'm thinking in kanji. When it's like now, you can procure it yourself, and I too.

64
00:06:45,169 --> 00:07:00,144
If you think it's decreasing, just a little. I went shopping vertically.

65
00:07:00,144 --> 00:07:15,139
I wonder if that child's delivery will end at 3 o'clock. For example, crushing it. various.

66
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:30,126
Thank you for coming.

67
00:07:30,126 --> 00:07:45,183
The return of the map of India is also a little. Decoration. I'm happy to have it.

68
00:07:45,183 --> 00:08:00,122
For example, decorating rice with nothing.

69
00:08:00,122 --> 00:08:15,096
I think about it Yes.

70
00:08:15,096 --> 00:08:30,136
It's a bit like a country company. I wonder if there are two people this time. If you think about it.

71
00:08:30,136 --> 00:08:45,114
When there is no place to use the toilet. Around this area.

72
00:08:45,114 --> 00:09:00,115
I'm wondering if I should eat fire fighting today. This is a little. I was sold when I thought that there would be no place to inherit.

73
00:09:00,115 --> 00:09:15,125
A growing tea beverage. Well, it's 30 minutes, so well. So that's it.

74
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:30,101
If I eat it, I'll increase it as much as I can. Right now, I'm the only one, so I only have one.

75
00:09:30,101 --> 00:09:45,145
We are planning to line up a lot. After that. Everyone, that one.

76
00:09:45,145 --> 00:10:00,142
I want an idea. But a little idea I want to think a little.

77
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:15,141
Will it be that headquarters? Let's imagine that.

78
00:10:15,141 --> 00:10:30,150
I have some money, so if you personally become a celebrity garden, please do. I'm curious, this is really beautiful, this is a little borderline.

79
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:45,171
Come on, hey. The color of sputum. I was really curious about this.

80
00:10:45,171 --> 00:11:00,129
I don't make it. What to make for the first TNT code.

81
00:11:00,129 --> 00:11:15,175
I think the members are probably thinking about what to make, so I'm looking forward to it, but if everyone. That's true.

82
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:30,088
I want a private school, like a library. It looks like it would be really fun to be in a library around here.

83
00:11:30,088 --> 00:11:45,138
I read a book while looking at this landscape. not good. I was enthusiastic about making a shirt with 2 stars.

84
00:11:45,138 --> 00:12:00,141
Already. Where do you want to make it? Where do you make it?

85
00:12:00,141 --> 00:12:15,170
It's OK even if you spread it sideways. Please do it.

86
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:30,123
I wonder what to do By the way, I also want to make a cat, so I'm banning construction. The mark of Pakukin Construction is actually.

87
00:12:30,123 --> 00:12:45,117
It's not sunny. I want to make a song. Where is where where is it warmed up.

88
00:12:45,117 --> 00:13:00,091
this. This mark.

89
00:13:00,091 --> 00:13:15,140
Papapapapapa. At this rate, it's just a difference or a celebrity. You're looking at a really beautiful company. It's a little unique.

90
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:30,091
Something like wool. I'm thinking.

91
00:13:30,091 --> 00:13:45,121
Make goods or get out. But I wonder if that is the color that isn't enough.

92
00:13:45,121 --> 00:14:00,122
There is no wool.

93
00:14:00,122 --> 00:14:15,167
It's hard to find this wind. Light blue with light blue flowers.

94
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:30,196
I wondered if I would use it because everyone might use it, even if it stood up. Let's go get the light blue wool.

95
00:14:30,196 --> 00:14:45,142
There was medical treatment at all. Ah-chan with this. It's the opening ceremony with Tet, so it's quick.

96
00:14:45,142 --> 00:15:00,145
Make a mark. A baton touch to Shiranuhi Construction Bath and Nee-san.

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,093
This will be erased.

98
00:00:15,093 --> 00:00:30,094
It won't break. By the way.

99
00:00:30,094 --> 00:00:45,099
That school inspection is OK. OK why. Box please.

100
00:00:45,099 --> 00:01:00,114
Like Freedom Smile. Smile. To the Pinarello company.

101
00:01:00,114 --> 00:01:15,121
It is 10. Rules. I entered here.

102
00:01:15,121 --> 00:01:30,129
The front is not noticeable. Will it get in the way?

103
00:01:30,129 --> 00:01:45,047
Let's make it.

104
00:01:45,047 --> 00:02:00,053
Is it here?

105
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:15,137
Okoniko. I will make it. That side job is also OK. That's a little more.

106
00:02:15,137 --> 00:02:30,105
I wonder if I can get along and have fun. Ordinary roulette. As much as possible.

107
00:02:30,105 --> 00:02:45,158
I wish I could touch the next person with a baton. I actually asked if I would like to make a work call. What should I do?

108
00:02:45,158 --> 00:03:00,145
I went to that bridge or went a little closer, but he said that he wanted to do what he wanted to do, so maybe. I can't show you.

109
00:03:00,145 --> 00:03:15,105
You may have a work call. Hey everyone, I tried to talk to you, if you like.

110
00:03:15,105 --> 00:03:30,161
While. Mandatory is a specialized course. Everyone feels like I want to go to Exe.

111
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:45,083
I was very happy. It's growth I feel growth.

112
00:03:45,083 --> 00:04:15,108
Counterprogram There is no counterprogram I'm sorry everyone. Please take a look at this distribution that you are doing when you wire the relay.

113
00:04:15,108 --> 00:04:30,141
I think I'm working a little bit.

114
00:04:30,141 --> 00:04:45,144
It's not pants Who said pants? That's really going to happen. Everyone isn't wearing pants.

115
00:04:45,144 --> 00:05:00,086
I want to make it a little sharper. I want to show it off.

116
00:05:00,086 --> 00:05:30,054
concern.

117
00:05:30,054 --> 00:05:45,196
Not pants. No.

118
00:05:45,196 --> 00:06:00,140
There were a lot of them. Did you get angry?

119
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:15,097
3D was cute. When it's done properly, it really looks like pants.

120
00:06:15,097 --> 00:06:30,098
I said about 5 of them today, so I thought I'd go for an interview.

121
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:45,084
very good. Upper right head.

122
00:06:45,084 --> 00:07:00,172
Narumi-chan I interviewed a little and went to the store. What are you planning to make?

123
00:07:00,172 --> 00:07:15,171
Bring the Ashime Short, and start the opening with the intention of starting to run. It's gone now.

124
00:07:15,171 --> 00:07:30,094
What do you call me?

125
00:07:30,094 --> 00:07:45,123
Yami Yami Yami. First over the summer. Did I do it?

126
00:07:45,123 --> 00:08:00,068
Yes.

127
00:08:00,068 --> 00:08:15,139
Which one. Are you there I want to print it to everyone, but I wonder if anyone will come in. now.

128
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:30,053
Cat.

129
00:08:30,053 --> 00:08:45,087
I made a prototype. Say everyone. The monsters are really boiling.

130
00:08:45,087 --> 00:09:00,047
interview.

131
00:09:00,047 --> 00:09:15,132
I wonder if it's okay. I was defeating it. Do something forever.

132
00:09:15,132 --> 00:09:30,145
Because I was logged in instead, I think everyone is preparing. I will ask.

133
00:09:30,145 --> 00:09:45,147
The creeper. Roxy House I only sleep for 30 minutes in the morning.

134
00:09:45,147 --> 00:10:00,083
I was wondering if I should try it. Even if it's not halfway. What's this.

135
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:15,128
What's this. How would you like it?

136
00:10:15,128 --> 00:10:30,051
looking forward to.

137
00:10:30,051 --> 00:10:45,137
Why my beans. Let me.

138
00:10:45,137 --> 00:11:00,042
Good evening.

139
00:11:00,042 --> 00:11:15,101
What?

140
00:11:15,101 --> 00:11:30,113
Are you thinking?

141
00:11:30,113 --> 00:11:45,100
Please tell me because it's okay. Yesterday it was so cute at 3. Because it was a routine.

142
00:11:45,100 --> 00:12:00,161
I said it in one word.

143
00:12:00,161 --> 00:12:15,083
What are you going to make?

144
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:30,165
Why do you say that? No matter who sings, I'm a full-time employee Kasukabe I'm trying my best Noisy. Yes.

145
00:12:30,165 --> 00:13:00,152
It's rude to eat rice, peaches. Well everyone's.

146
00:13:00,152 --> 00:13:15,142
why. What are you going to make? Nakasu.

147
00:13:15,142 --> 00:13:30,072
Nagashi Somen noodles. So that's it. There is.

148
00:13:30,072 --> 00:13:45,133
By the way. Pooh's. The material is.

149
00:13:45,133 --> 00:14:00,098
I wonder if it will be made.

150
00:14:00,098 --> 00:14:15,203
I think it's a quartz block of songs for a long time, and Katata, Otsu-shi, Ward. Quartz maybe.

151
00:14:15,203 --> 00:14:30,152
I'm sorry it was the snow I took in front of the board house.

152
00:14:30,152 --> 00:14:45,118
Excuse me. I'm busy.

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,105
Nagasu. I don't know for a moment.

154
00:00:15,105 --> 00:00:30,101
But it's a little difficult, so I think there isn't enough material. Maybe it's normal. I feel like that.

155
00:00:30,101 --> 00:00:45,137
I think it's impossible, but I can do a softball fix. I think that. Is it really bone or concrete?

156
00:00:45,137 --> 00:01:15,101
I feel like that. Thank you Ramírez, I'm sorry, there are so many people who were interviewed.

157
00:01:15,101 --> 00:01:30,094
It was an interview.

158
00:01:30,094 --> 00:01:45,094
Hateruma is said to be Shiranui Flair-chan's 8. I'll be obsessed with it. Pretending to be a man I want to make a baton touch at the end.

159
00:01:45,094 --> 00:02:00,098
Let's ask.

160
00:02:00,098 --> 00:02:15,086
If possible, I made a mistake as it is. like this.

161
00:02:15,086 --> 00:03:15,101
You want to ask what you make. what.

162
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:30,083
I was very nervous.

163
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:45,116
iris. It seems OK. It's just an idea.

164
00:03:45,116 --> 00:04:00,118
It's very similar. I can think of this now.

165
00:04:00,118 --> 00:04:15,135
It's March 7th. It's really good. I don't know if I can do it.

166
00:04:15,135 --> 00:04:30,122
Peko Everyone is doing it in the last minute, so it's a bit tough.

167
00:04:30,122 --> 00:04:45,145
Only plums until what time. 8.

168
00:04:45,145 --> 00:05:00,131
I think so let's stop for a moment. This time twice. Because it's the first time after the opening ceremony.

169
00:05:00,131 --> 00:05:15,071
Was good.

170
00:05:15,071 --> 00:05:30,178
Ready to go.

171
00:05:30,178 --> 00:05:45,062
actor.

172
00:05:45,062 --> 00:06:00,094
That Jasdaq.

173
00:06:00,094 --> 00:06:15,128
Please rely on me.

174
00:06:15,128 --> 00:06:30,099
That's right, it's durable and messed up. Please go through.

175
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:45,143
I was saying that. In front of Dorami's house. Yukimi Daifuku.

176
00:06:45,143 --> 00:07:00,148
I thought I was sane.

177
00:07:00,148 --> 00:07:15,137
By the way, nothing except my sister. Yuki Even if I break it, I won't remake it.

178
00:07:15,137 --> 00:07:30,118
There are several, but here. If not, if you don't know, Akari.

179
00:07:30,118 --> 00:07:45,125
Beyblade.

180
00:07:45,125 --> 00:08:00,154
It's a little small. with this. If you're not careful, it's washed.

181
00:08:00,154 --> 00:08:15,127
In the memo. With a voice that sympathizes.

182
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:30,079
That is also one.

183
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:45,113
What are you planning to make? today. I want you to have an office.

184
00:08:45,113 --> 00:09:15,163
Is it today? Somehow so scary friends. I thought I'd make it if I didn't prepare it, but I stopped by yesterday.

185
00:09:15,163 --> 00:09:30,129
I was wondering if I should make a light. Bad head Bad head.

186
00:09:30,129 --> 00:09:45,146
It's too disturbing, isn't it? Sound construction in Akita. There should be a good child.

187
00:09:45,146 --> 00:10:15,107
I'm this one. That's right. You may say that you changed it to brown around here.

188
00:10:15,107 --> 00:10:30,098
Even with a backpack, the hot water supply room is on the first floor, isn't it?

189
00:10:30,098 --> 00:10:45,127
I'm thinking of making this one. After all, please replace it with that nice feeling. It's kind of amazing, but it's okay to make it freely.

190
00:10:45,127 --> 00:11:00,115
I don't want to make 9 points in front of me.

191
00:11:00,115 --> 00:11:15,107
Where and where should I go? Shiranuhi Construction.

192
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:30,102
Ah, I think this is a cute corner with 9. It's really awesome.

193
00:11:30,102 --> 00:11:45,151
If you use a bird, it will be a hot water supply room. It seems awkward, so where should I go?

194
00:11:45,151 --> 00:12:00,055
I agree.

195
00:12:00,055 --> 00:12:15,195
Nobody made the entrance, so I realized something was wrong. If you make a hole in the entrance, it will be 9 and it can't be helped.

196
00:12:15,195 --> 00:12:30,132
Entrance. Let's pray for you.

197
00:12:30,132 --> 00:12:45,167
Please remodel a lot of Thomas. Let's start wiring the ischium as well, so my sister will make a hot water supply room.

198
00:12:45,167 --> 00:13:00,124
I made a schedule and did not know the construction. Thank you.

199
00:13:00,124 --> 00:13:15,112
The URL is pasted in the mark summary column of professional baseball, so let's enter there. Really.
